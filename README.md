# Football-Refactor

This fantasy football application was the first app I had ever written for fun.

It was sophomore year in college (Fall of 2004) and this was a time where fantasy football sites didn't have live scoring (unless you paid them, and as I was in college, no chance that was happening.)  I ended up making my own Java application where I could bring in text files with teams' rosters, punch in their stats, and get a team's total score.  It wasn't terribly efficient but it was better than calculating everything by hand.  And yes, I now realize that this could have been an Excel spreadsheet, but I had fun making it!  It was the first time I really got into software development and it started being a thing I really wanted to do.

At some point, I'll refactor the app to show how far I've come along.  Maybe.
